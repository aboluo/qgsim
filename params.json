{"name":"QSIM","tagline":"Quality Similarity Clustering Algorithm","body":"### Welcome to QSIM Clustering Algorithm page.\r\nThis is a clustering algorithm based on similarity values. The main feature of QSIM is that it keeps a quality between cluster's elements with a minimal similarity value. \r\n\r\nMore about QSIM can be found [here](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-39209-2_55)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2013, Andrey A. Masiero (@amasiero) presented QSIM as results of his master's thesis. He coded QSIM with Java Programming Language. His research continues to improve QSIM performance.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you need some help with QSIM or you want to contribute for improving it please contact me.\r\n\r\nMy email address is amasiero [at] fei (dot) edu {dot} br\r\n\r\nEnjoy it!","google":"QSIM \"Clustering Algorithm\" \"Quality Similarity\" Similarity ","note":"Don't delete this file!
